# Dev Config

A repository that tracks my development environment setup making it easy to set up new machines

## General Approach

In general, the scripts at the root of this repo will install the application they are named after. Any files needed by the scripts will be in a corresponding directory.

## Platform Dependencies

In order for this setup to work where I work it needs to work on multiple distributions (Almalinux 9 and CachyOS), as these ditros are quite different (one is RHEL based the other Arch Based) they need separate scripts for installing dependencies.
